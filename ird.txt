The institutions of Resolution Disputes (i.R.D.) call attention to media resolutions. While a 'resolution' generally simply refers to a standard (measurement) embedded in the technological domain, the iRD reflect on the fact that a resolution is indeed a settlement (solution), but at the same time a space of compromise between different actors (objects, materialities and protocols) who dispute their stakes (framerate, number of pixels etc.) within the growing digital territories.

Resolutions inform both machine vision and human modes of perception. They ubiquitously shape the material of everyday life. They shape the material of everyday life ubiquitously. They do this not just as an "interface effect" but as hyperopic lens, obfuscating any other possible alternative resolution from the users media literacy.

The question is, have we become unable to construct our own resolutions, or have we become oblivious to them? Either way we are in need for another re-"(Re-)Distribution of the Sensible".

iRD intend to impose methods of "creative problem creation" to bring authorship back to the layer of setting a 'resolution'. The radical digital materialist believes in an "informed materiality"; while every string of data is ambiguously fluid and has the potential to be manipulated into anything, every piece of information functions within /adhesive*/ encoding, contextualization and embedding (etc).

Through iRDs tactics beyond resolution, the otherwise grey mundane objects of everyday-life show their colors. iRD are not a wunderkabinet of dead media, but a foggy bootleg trails for vernacular resistance.
